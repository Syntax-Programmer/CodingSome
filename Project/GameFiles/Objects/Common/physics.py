We assume that no object can accelerate ever.

If anyone wishes to change that you can do so by making a
function that takes the acceleration and calculate the delta
vel the same way as the calculate_delta_dist function and return acc * delta time.
Same can be done for if the object can experience jerk(variable acceleration).
